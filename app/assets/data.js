	description: "This engagement ring is designed for those who love simple with a slight twist. The cushion cut in the center is traditional while the cushion halo gives it a little bit of interest without being too simple. All stones used are only premium cut, fairly traded, and/or conflict-free! Our diamonds are always natural NEVER treated or enhanced for better color or clarity. Our products are only created with the finest of recycled metals. Rosados Boxâ„¢ works hard to save the world one piece of jewelry at a time! :) To see the wedding set options, please click here: https://www.etsy.com/listing/171652519/catalina-14kt-white-gold-cushion-fb To see the matching ring, please click here: https://www.etsy.com/listing/159269944/platinummatching-band-to-kimberly-almost?ref=shop_home_active&ga_search_query=kimberly To see other cushion cut styles, please click here: https://www.etsy.com/shop/RosadosBox/search?search_query=cushion+moissanite+halo&order=date_desc&view_type=gallery&ref=shop_search Center Stone Moissanite Specifications: Center Stone: Forever One GHI Moissanite by Charles & Colvard Color: Sparkles like a diamond! Near-colorless. Yay! Shape: Square Cushion Cut Measurement: 7.5mm Weight: Approximately 2.00cts Quality:AAA Diamonds on the ring: Diamonds goes roughly 3/4 around on a size 6.5 Diamond Weight: approx 0.32cts Diamond Quality: G in color SI in clarity Total Halo Diameter: approx 10mm Band Width: approx 1.45mm Disclaimer: Due to the lower body and open gallery design, we highly recommend having your wedding ring soldered to this engagement ring or have the engagement ring worn alone (without other rings next to it). We have found that sometimes when bands are worn together, the wedding bands can slide up and hit the center stone causing the center stone to possibly chip; having the rings soldered will greatly reduce that likelihood. We recommend that all jewelry be worn mindfully in order to preserve each item&#39;s original integrity. Sizes available: 3.5-8 (Larger and smaller sizes are available. Priced upon request) Please note needed size when checking out. Metal Available: 14kt White Gold (priced as shown), 14kt/18kt yellow gold, 14kt/18kt white gold, 14kt/18kt rose gold, platinum. Please allow 2-3 weeks for item to be handcrafted from scratch.

We offer 1 free resizing within 3 months of purchase (excluding our &quot;Chic Classics Collection&quot;) If the size adjustment is within 3.5-8, there no charge for your resizing but you are responsible for shipping to and from our studio. Should the size be larger or smaller than our standard ring size 3.5-8, we will charge market price for the size adjustment. For our Chic Classics Collection, you have 30 days to exchange the ring size for ONLY the price difference between the listed sizes. After the 30 days, there will be labor fee plus the additional materials needed for the size adjustment.

For repairs specifically, take photos of the area that needs to be repaired. MAKE SURE PRIOR TO SEALING the package that the inside, the jewelry is, unable to shift around inside the box.

Please also include within the package 1) a copy of your original receipt, 2) a copy of the signed DocuSign. Please allow about 2 weeks for the repair/adjustment, unless otherwise specified. Section 2. (3 D Custom Experience) This process is only available for redesigning for different center stone size/shape or new complete custom designs. We will not do the 3D Custom Experience for a different stone color, ring size, or metal color. Thank you for understanding! Within approx 1.5 weeks of your purchase/deposit (we need the project to be paid at least at 50% of total amount to launch project from start to finish), you will receive a 3D rendering of your designed piece of jewelry! We will wait for approval or the needed changes. If changes are needed, please allow 1-3 business days for the changes to be made. We will again email you the new CAD; you are allowed up to 5 sessions of changes. To be honest, we have never had to do more than 3 times because usually get it right 75% percent of the time on the first try, 20% on the second, and the remaining 5% is for the slight adjustments! Upon approval of the 3D CAD, we will shoot straight to finishing the ring which will take roughly 3 weeks for growing the wax, molding, casting, setting the stones, additional engravings, and quality control. IF you are adding milgrain detail to the ring, please allow an extra 1-3 business days on top of that. We will email you a photograph of the item when finished and wait for the approval prior to shipping out the item. When we receive the approval, we will ship out promptly if the item is paid in full. If the item has a remaining balance, we ask for the remaining balance to be paid in full prior to shipping out. Please note, once we decide on a design for the 3D experience we cannot make extreme changes in the design such as having a ring start as a simple solitaire and change it into a halo ring with accent flowers and pave diamonds; this is because it requires the 3D CAD to be completely redesigned. If the changes were adding to the height, bringing the split on the shank further down, or having the stones go further down the ring, etcâ€¦ these changes are not a problem at all. You will be charged for new CAD fees if you change you mind on the overall design, shape of stone, size of the stone, or anything that requires complete rebuilding of the ring from ground up. For further information on the custom design process, please do not hesitate to contact me. Section 3. (Payment Plan/Layaway) We are pretty flexible on the manner of which you&#39;d like to pay. We only ask that the item be paid in full WITHIN 3 months. So by the time you make the final payment, your ring will be ready to ship out. We use a program that sends an email that attaches an invoice that details your project. To pay each time, just reference the same invoice link we had sent you to make your payments. Every time you place a payment, you will receive a follow up email that details your deposited amount for your record; the amount deposited will automatically deducted from the remaining total. Yup!!! It&#39;s that easy! Please note, we will NOT start the project until the item is at least 50% paid off. Thank you in advance for understanding. Layaway option is not available for certified diamond engagement rings that are 1ct and over (center stone). All layaway projects are non refundable; this includes partial payments.

For all of those who are concerned with the security of your credit card info, we do NOT store any of your credit card info. It is all encrypted and processed through the merchant companies used. Section 4. (How to Care for Your Jewelry Guidelines) 1) Remember this rule: First to take off and Last to put on! Always put your jewelry on last after all your make up, hair styling, and putting on all your clothing. Always take off your jewelry for anything strenuous such as working out or lifting heavy objects. This includes ANY type of workout, including yoga, weights, dancing etc....Every time pressure is put on a ring (even thick rings) it will shift the original shape, after about 100 times of shifting the ring, and the original foundation will change. That&#39;s why all rings&#39; stone will eventually loosen with continuous impact. 2) When putting on your ring, NEVER place any pressure directly onto the center stone. ALWAYS when putting on the ring 1) hold the ring with the center stone upright (facing north) 2) With the pointer finger holding on the west side of the ring and the thumb holding the east side 3) GENTLY/Slowly WIGGLE the ring past the knuckle. Never shove the ring past the knuckle as it will injure your knuckle and possibly damage the ring. Think of it like forcing a size 7 into a pair of size 5 shoes; it&#39;s neither good for the foot and shoe :/ 3) ALWAYS take off all jewelry prior to going to bed. Your blankets can catch onto the prongs and break them off or you can damage the ring by hitting your hands against the headboard. 4) NEVER put your jewelry into any harsh chemicals such as chlorine, bleach, hairspray, etc... These chemicals break down and wear away the original chemical composition of the metals or damage the stones. 5) NEVER wear the rings with rubber/latex gloves; the tension/pressure from the tightness will loosen prongs and then cause the stone(s) to eventually loosen and/or fallout; in addition, the prongs can potentially puncture the gloves causing cross contamination. Wearing loose winter gloves, pulling gently on and off is ok. 6) ALWAYS Store all jewelry in room/cool temperature and AWAY from sunlight. The sunlight can damage certain gemstones like how it can damage your skin. Yikes! 7) Make sure to have your jewelry checked by a local jeweler or you can have the item sent back to us for inspection and tightening anywhere from every 3-6 months, if worn daily, in general for all jewelry. For full eternity rings and micropave rings, stones would need to be inspected/tightened at least every 3 months as these ring are require more care due to design. This is a like a regular check up for a car, since the ring is made with teeny tiny prongs, readjustments are necessary when the item has been banged around and endured everyday terrain! This will keep your ring in great condition and prevent stones from coming out! 8) If you&#39;d like to avoid your center stone from clouding up or getting less shiny from residue and buildup, please avoid washing your hands with soap, showering, applying lotion. The soap and lotion builds up and causes the stone to appear cloudy. Please following this links procedures on how to clean the ring if it does get &quot;cloudy&quot; http://www.fabsugar.com/How-Clean-Your-Engagement-Ring-Home-23340801 9) Finally, always wear your jewelry with responsibility. Please note, all jewelry that is designed with delicacy needs tender loving care! Jewelry is not resistant to normal wear, activities or trauma; this is especially true for rings since hands are regularly subjected to extensive abuse. General rule of thumb, the more delicate and detailed the piece the more you should be gentle and wear with care. When worn with care, the item&#39;s quality will last longer. Hopefully this information will help you maintain and keep all your jewelry beautiful! Yay! If you may need any additional detail on care for certain stones, please do not hesitate to contact us. Section 5. (1 Year Limited Manufacturer Warranty Against Defect) We are confident in our quality and service! :) We, at Rosados Boxâ„¢, are confident in our work! That is why all of our products sold come with a 1 year limited warranty against any manufacturing defect. If you believe your item has a manufacturer defect, please contact us immediately. If we deem your merchandise is damaged due to a manufacturing defect, we will repair the merchandise at no charge. If we deem your item is not a manufacturer defect, we will reach out to you regarding the possible options for repair and the charges for the service. The warranty does not cover jewelry that is purposely damaged or not worn responsibly. Any alternations not made by our company will void the warranty. Our shop warranty does not cover damages occurred under normal wear and tear, trauma, or activities.* If the product does not undergo the tightening/check up every 6 months, we reserve the right to cease the limited manufacturer warranty. You are responsible for the shipping and handling charges to and from our shop for all services. Rosados Boxâ„¢ offers lifetime free tightening and check ups. We suggest all jewelry worn regularly to be checked and tightened at least once every 6 months; ideally every 3 months. This is because the stones are all held by prongs and they can easily snag on things or get knocked around quite a bit from wearing; this can loosen the stones with time. You are responsible for the shipping and handling charges to and from our shop for this service. For coverage beyond the 1 year limited manufacturer warranty, please ask for an appraisal at no charge when checking out so that you can get the ring insured from your own private insurance company in the event of an unlikely occurrence. We highly recommend www.jewelersmutual.com for a good reliable jewelry insurance company. *Conditions for Warranty: Please bear in mind, jewelry is not resistant to normal wear, activities or trauma. This is especially true for rings since hands are regularly subjected to extensive abuse. We do not provide warranties for damage due to normal wear, product loss, loss of stones or theft. We do not cover damage or loss resulted from failure to receive to obtain necessary repairs in order to maintain the integrity of the product. Here are some examples of common jewelry concerns that would not be considered manufacturing defects: -Discoloration due to exposure to chemicals or makeup -Prongs and precious metals, in general, wear down and may require rebuilding over time. -Bent, caught, broken, or worn down prongs(s) allowing a stone to fall out or be lost due to normal wear or activities. -Loss of stone or a stone has fallen out due to chipping or breaking caused by normal wear or trauma.",
